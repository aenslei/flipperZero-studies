Learning how to create simple USB payloads using duckyScript and Powershell for the Flipper Zero!
Documenting my self-led journey in learning how to write USB payloads.

# Learning how to do Keystroke Injection
This first folder consists of all my attempts to master Keystroke Injections on Windows machines

**Script #1**: printingText.txt
*Self explanatory. I got text echoed on a Powershell CLI.*
**Script #2**: makingADirectory.txt
*Also self explanatory.*
**Script #3**: creatingFile.txt
*Created a new directory, made a text file and added content into it before opening up.*
**Script #4**: readAndDupe.txt
*Read the content of a file and duplicate it to another folder.*
**Script #4**: refiningReadAndDupe.txt
*This was a failed experiment, unfortunately. I had no idea that the FZ BadUSB didn't take in DEFINE and VAR in duckyScript. Sad :(*
