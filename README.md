Learning how to create simple USB payloads using duckyScript and Powershell for the Flipper Zero!
Documenting my self-led journey in learning how to write USB payloads.

# Wifi
Consists of all my Wifi-related duckyScripts.

**Script #7**: nearbyNetworks.txt
*A simple script that enumerates nearby Wifi networks.*

# Powershell Basics and Keystroke Injection
This first folder consists of all my attempts to master Powershell and Keystroke Injections on Windows machines

**Script #6**: deleteFile.txt

*Deletes a file using an externally downloaded Powershell script and deletes said script after. I learnt a LOT in this script.*

**Script #5**: refiningReadAndDupe.txt
*This was a failed experiment, unfortunately. I had no idea that the FZ BadUSB didn't take in DEFINE and VAR in duckyScript. Sad :(*

**Script #4**: readAndDupe.txt
*Read the content of a file and duplicate it to another folder.*

**Script #3**: creatingFile.txt
*Created a new directory, made a text file and added content into it before opening up.*

**Script #2**: makingADirectory.txt
*Also self explanatory.*

**Script #1**: printingText.txt
*Self explanatory. I got text echoed on a Powershell CLI.*
